# mvp-firebase-code
This is the code to be used for the tutorial MVP. Each chapter has a start and end point so you can follow along. Typically the start point of a chapter is the end of the previous but there are some differences.

You should be able to follow without using this but its up to you. To use try the following:

```bash
git checkout chapter_2_start
cd mvp-with-angular-firebase
npm install
ng serve
```
